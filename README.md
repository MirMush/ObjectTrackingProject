# ObjectTrackingProject
YOLOv11-Based Multi-Class Object Tracking & Pose Estimation
Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection, tracking, and pose estimation system using YOLOv11.

The system detects, tracks, and classifies five object classes, while estimating:

Class label

3D position (X, Y, Z)

Orientation angle (θ)

It is designed for robotics and autonomous systems applications where spatial awareness and object pose estimation are required.

Features

Real-time object detection using YOLOv11

Multi-object tracking with persistent IDs

5-class classification

3D coordinate estimation (X, Y, Z)

Orientation angle estimation

Structured output for robotics integration

Modular pipeline for deployment in edge or embedded systems
